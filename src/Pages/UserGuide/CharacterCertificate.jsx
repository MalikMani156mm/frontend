          Police Character Certificate is required for travelling abroad, jobs
          in different organizations abroad, immigration etc. Previously,
          getting character certificate was a complex and time-taking process
          not just for citizens but for the police too. Police Khidmat Markaz has simplified and
          made it time-efficient.
